== A guide for managers

The target reader for this book is a manager who needs to act on the imperative to "create value with data" in their organization:

- Comex members in charge of deploying the strategic vision of the CEO
- Directors of business units and functional teams who must translate the directions of the Comex into concrete business projects and perspectives for development

DATOM is a step-by-step method guiding managers from a stated strategic vision to plans for action for projects with a data-centric logic.

== Benefits of the method

- Create business projects aligned with the strategic objectives of the organisation
- With precise instructions on how to include a data driven logic in the value creation process
- Graphical method, suitable for individual and team work
